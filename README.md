# Integer Quantum Hall Effect Simulation

A numerical study of the lowest Landau level, simulating a 2D system under high magnetic field with a Gaussian White noise random potential. An optimized Python-based approach for solving eigenstates of the system's Hamiltonian for the analysis of Chern number statistics.
